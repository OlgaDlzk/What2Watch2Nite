![istockphoto-1312418309-170667a copy](https://github.com/OlgaDlzk/What2Watch2Nite/assets/44728723/e9781802-ee01-4207-8713-f26bce4727a9)

## Motivation
For Project 4, we were asked to analyze, visualize and/or solve a problem with Machine Learning using Scikit-learn and two of the following technologies: Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML,CSS,Bootstrap, SQL or MongoDB database, Google Cloude SQL, Amazon AWS or Tableau. This machine learning model and web application were constructed in 14 days.

CHANGE THIS TEXT....With so many viewing and entertainment choices, it can be difficult and frustrating to select which movie or TV show to watch. So we set out to build a recommendation system for movies AND TV shows to make it easier for our users to choose **"What2Watch2Nite"**.

## Data Description
- We used 2 datasets housed on Kaggle for this project. A movie dataset containing over 700,000 records scraped daily from The Movie Dabtbase (TMDB) which contain the following information:  title, cast, crew, plot keywords, genres, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote count and vote average and reviews.
- The second dataset has over 150,000 records for TV Serioes scrpaed from TMDB and updated weekly.  This dataset contains the following metadata: title, first/last air date, in production (T/F), number of episodes/seasons, country, language, series overview, popularity, TMDB vote count and vote average. 
- The original data can be found here:  [movie data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies) and [tv show data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bourdier/all-tv-series-details-dataset).

## Web Application Overview

- We deployed Flask as the web server to host the page routes and XXXX
- The web application navigation contains links to 4 webpages (Project Overview, Movies, TV Shows and Our Team) and a link to this GitHub repository. 
- To see the live version of the website application, download the source code and launch the Flask app.py file.  The web app is also hosted on render.com through the following link (UPDATE LINK):  [What2Watch2Nitee](https://grape-choice.onrender.com/)
